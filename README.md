# CallVitalz Call Intelligence Application

<strong>Reports and Analytics</strong><br/><br/>
Report elements are responsive (look good on any screen size). Each graph element loads asynchronously, as soon as data is ready. All quantitative graphic elements can drilldown to show relevant data in the bottom grid.

<strong>Voice recording, AI speech-to-text transcript, and extraction of key data points</strong><br/><br/>
After a patient completes a call with a health provider, the CallVitalz application uses API integration with the phone provider to fold the call metadata and call recording into a pipeline: the call recording is processed using AI speech-to-text service, with the transcript shown on the right of page. The transcript and metadata also goes through our custom-trained model to extract the key data points shown on the left half.
The screenshot below is from a fake/demo call.

Clients can configure different aspects of their phone handling: hours of operations, employees who need to receive alerts, keywords that need to be captured during a phone call, etc. Clients can click the Edit button to update any phone number settings such as routing the main line to a different target number when main receptionist is on lunch break.
