Report elements are responsive (look good on any screen size) and each graph element load asynchronously, as soon as data is ready. These give a satisfying user experience.

Call detail, recording audio, and transcript.
When user clicks on a specific line of transcript, the audio will jump to that point.
The transcript's starting point is speech-to-text AI. Human transcribers can listen to the call and edit the transcript for further accuracy.
The data points on the left half are determined by Machine Learning.
The screenshot below is from a fake/demo call.

Clients can configure different aspects of their phone handling: hours of operations, employees who need to receive alerts, keywords that need to be captured during a phone call, etc. Clients can click the Edit button to update any phone number settings such as routing the main line to a different target number when main receptionist is on lunch break.

When a phone call ends, the CallVitalz application uses API integration with the phone provider to fold the call details and audio into its pipeline. The end result is shown in screenshot above.
